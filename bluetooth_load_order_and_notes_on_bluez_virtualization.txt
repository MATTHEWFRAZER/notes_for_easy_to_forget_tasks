create vhci device -> open file descriptor to hci_vhci -> register vhci::vhci_write_callback (as send_handler in btdev) and register vhci::vhci_read_callback (as mainloop callback)

(receive and response path)
mainloop_run -> epoll_wait (causes hci_vhci's vhci_poll to be called) -> vhci::vhci_read_callback -> btdev::btdev_receive_h4 -> btdev::send_packet -> vhci::vhci_write_callback(send_handler) -> \
writev -> vhci_write -> vhci_get_user -> hci_recv_frame (or create device for HCI_VENDOR_PKT)


AFH - adaptive frequency hopping (made so that interference is reduced; when a link is formed the devices
      are synchronized to change channels together many times a second. The pattern is called a hop 
	  sequence and is unique for each link)
	  
ISO - isochronous channels (isoc). Allows the ability to synchronize time-sensitive data streams across
	  multiple receivers. Supports connection oriented and broadcast. 
	  
ACL - asynchronous connection-less, for general frame. Two frame types: DH (which doesn't provide FEC, Forward Error Connection) and DM which does provide FEC
	  For DH and DM, a number is appended to these frame types to indicate how many 625 usec. "slot" will be occupied. ACL is multipoint connection between 
	  one master and many slaves

SCO - synchronous connection oriented for synchronous audio frame. For realtime/voice/video. fixed bandwidth channels and can have max of 3 channels per device
	  SCO is point to point connection between only one master and only one slave

BLE - Bluetooth Low Energy
	  
GATT - for BLE, an acronym for Generic Attribute Profile. Defines the way two BLE devices transfer data back and
	   forth using concepts called Services and Characteristics. Makes use of a generic protocal called the Attribute
	   protocol (ATT), which is used to store services, characteristics and related data in a simple lookup table
	   using 16 bit ids for each entry. GATT comes into play once a dedicated connection is established. The most important
	   thing with GATT and connectiosn is that connections are exclusive

BLE vs Bluetooth - BLE is developed to take care of sending small chunks of data (Iot). bluetooth is used for network requiring
				   data exchange as well as wireless headset and other consumer devices. BLE operates in the same band as standard
				   bluetooth but uses different FHSS scheme. BLE devices are not compatible with bluetooth devices and will not interoperate
				   
BR/EDR - Bluetooth basic rate/Enhanced data rate. BLE modules target applications that require both BLE and classic connectivity. This means classic and BLE are both supported

SSP - Secure Simple Pairing fixes issues of the original pairing method. The process of pairing in general is aimed at creating a shared secret called a Link Key
      This Link Key authenticates paired devices to each other. Uses Diffie-Hellman key 

LMP - Link Management Protocol. Used for control of the radio link between two devices, highe, dmv, querying device abilities and power control. Implemented on the controller

AMP - alternate MAC/PHY. Enables the use of alternative MAC and PHY's for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial
      connection and profile configuration. However, when large quantaties of data must be sent, the high-speed alternative MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with WIFI)
	  transports the data. THis means that Bluetooth uses proven low power connection models when the system is idle, and the faster radio when it must send large quantities
	  of data. AMP links require enhanced L2CAP modes.
	  
HCI - Standardized communication between host stack (e.g., a PC or mobile phone OS) and the controller (the Bluetooth integrated circuit (IC)). This standard allows the host stack
      or controller IC to be swapped with minimal adaption. There are several HCI transport standards, each using a different hardware interface to transfer the same command,
	  event and data packets. The most commonly used are (USB in PCs) and UART (in mobile phones and PDAs). In Bluetooth devices with simple functionality (e.g. headsets),
	  the host stack and controller can be implemented on the same microprocessor. In this case the HCI is optional, although often implemented as an internal software interface

SMP - Security Manager Protocol is used for establishing pairing, authentication and encryption between Bluetooth LE devices
