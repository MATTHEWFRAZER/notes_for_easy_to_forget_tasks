bluez install
1. sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev (for glib 2.28 < issue)
2. sudo apt-get install python-docutils (for rst2man issue)
3. make sure line endings for files don't cause problems (for /bin/sh^M problem in ./obexd/src/genbuiltins and compilitation error in /src/plugin.c caused by /src/genbuiltins)
3. autoreconf --install
4. ./configure
5. make
6. to build btvirt -> uncomment input/dependencies -> make emulator/btvirt



from youtube:

1. change system directories in bootstrap-configure (--prefix, and --sysconfdir) so install doesn't ruin system until you're ready.  
2. ./bootstrap-configure (make sure all dependencies are in place)
3. sudo apt install libell-dev
4. (still had issues with ell dependency, but can build emulator) emulator/btvirt

after coming back and doing it again:
uncomment the following lines and you should be able to just make emulator/btvirt:
1. emulator_btvirt_SOURCES (if it isn't already uncommented)
2. am_emulator_btvirt_OBJECTS (emulator_btvirt_OBJECTS is defined using this)
